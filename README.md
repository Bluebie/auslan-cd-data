# auslan-cd-data
RIDBC published in Auslan CD-ROM based on Microsoft JET DB, Quicktime for Windows, and Macromedia Director technologies, all of
which are obsolete now. The CD continues to be a useful resource, especially in how it provided rich and detailed searchable
information about each Auslan sign's location, handshape, symmetry, and region information, much of which is difficult or
impossible for the general public to access on the modern Auslan SignBank website. This is a reverse engineering attempt to
make that dataset accessible in the modern era for language enthusiests and others who don't have access to the academic
channels required to gain access to the Auslan Sign Corpus that much of this is probably based on.

Software tools are released under the Unlicense software license. Data files (.json and .csv) might be affected by copyright
and it's unclear who holds that copyright. It's likely derived from the Auslan Corpus project, or maybe an ancestor of it. So, uh,
beware spooky legal things?
